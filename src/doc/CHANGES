2007-12-31 - from tukaani_1.2.4 to tukaani_1.3.0 (development version)

  * Made makerepo to process also the "patches" directory. Thanks
    to arny for noticing this.
  * Fixed a bug in functions.installpkg.sh, which broke rebuilding
    the texinfo's dir file if the ROOT variable is set. Thanks to
    Vladimir A. Pavlov for a patch.
  * Reject package names that begin with a dash. This works around
    bunch of bugs in pkgtools, trying to limit damage to package
    database.
  * Make "upgradepkg foo-1.23-i486-1%foo-1.24-i486-1" to remove
    only foo-1.23-i486-1, not all packages with basename foo. Plain
    "upgradepkg foo-1.24-i486-1" and "upgradepkg foo%foo-1.24-i486-1"
    still remove all packages with basename foo. Thanks to Vladimir
    A. Pavlov for problem description and the original patch.
  * Make it possible to remove the last package from the system
    with removepkg when used in combination with ROOT or --root.
    Thanks to Vladimir A. Pavlov for cleaner (and faster) fix than
    the original one in Slackware.
  * Don't log removal of package when using "removepkg --warn".
    Again, thanks to Vladimir A. Pavlov for the patch. :-)

2007-01-10 - from tukaani_1.2.3 to tukaani_1.2.4

  * Fixed a bug in functions.explode.sh that broke explodepkg and 
    convertpkg with RPM packages if /bin/sh was GNU bash 3.2.

---

2006-12-07 - from tukaani_1.2.2 to tukaani_1.2.3

  * Fixed a bug in installpkg and upgradepkg which made them misbehave
    with packages having symlinks in the tarball instead of in doinst.sh.
    Thanks to Phil DeVries for the bug report and debugging help.
  * Now it's possible to use subdirectories of official repositories
    in pkgtool e.g. ftp://foo.tld/slackware-xx.x/patches now works as
    expected. Thanks to Dexter Filmore for for the bug report.
  * Fixed a bug with spaces in filenames in makerepo. Thanks to
    Jakub Jankowski for the bug report.
  * Updated /usr/bin/xorgsetup from Slackware 11.0. This probably
    doesn't work with Slackware 10.x. I hope that everyone willing to
    use xorgsetup on their 10.x boxes have already run it. ;-)
  * Added rc.rpc and rc.scanluns to /var/log/setup/setup.services.
    They were added in Slackware 11.0.
  * Fixed path to xwmconfig in /var/log/setup/setup.xwmconfig.
  * Updated /etc/dialogrc from Slackware 11.0.

---

2006-08-06 - from tukaani_1.2.1 to tukaani_1.2.2

  * makerepo no longer generates unwanted files when only --manifest
    is used. This bug was reported by someone on #tukaani@Freenode
    but I don't remember his nick nor name, sorry and thank you.
  * Speed optimization made in installpkg had a small bug that prevented
    symlinks pointing to itself to not get overwritten
  * Fixed a typo in pkgtool. Thanks to Jakub Jankowski (shasta).
  * Added help command to pkgtool to be an alias for --help.
    Documented both in pkgtool.8.

---

2006-05-02 - from tukaani_1.2.0 to tukaani_1.2.1

  * Fixed a bug in pkgtool which broke `install-updates' command.
    Thanks to Daniel Liljeqvist (Dasajev) for the bug report.
  * Paritially fixed a bug in the installer where it prompts to
    rerun scripts. Hopefully we some day have a _simple_ and _reliable_
    installer, that will require writing things from scratch and not
    as sh-scripts!
  * Instead of creating a half dozen of packages, I made only two
    packages. The i486 package is without terminfo entries and works on
    Tukaani Solid & Edge, and Slackware 10.0 and later, including
    Current. The x86-64 package is for Slamd64 (all versions). It is
    VERY IMPORTANT that users have the ncurses package installed before
    upgrading the pkgtools package!

---

2006-04-01 - from tukaani_1.2.0rc1 to tukaani_1.2.0

  * Fixed bugs in command line mode of pkgtool, thanks
    to Teemu Suo-Anttila (Fal).
  * "pkgtool install foopkg" now installs the package "foopkg" from the
    default repository. Earlier only full package names with version and
    build numbers were supported.
  * makerepo now creates "ChangeLog.txt", not "ChangeLog".
  * Fixed mirrors.linuxpackages.name.txt and updated
    mirrors.tukaani.addresses.txt.
  * Made minor updates to man pages.
  * There will be packages for Tukaani, Slackware 10.x, Slackware Current,
    Slamd64 10.x and Slamd64 Current.
  * Time to call this a stable release. I'm not planning to add any new
    features unless they are trivial to implement. I *will* make bug
    fixes, so please report any bugs you find. (No April's fools here.)

---

2006-01-01 - from tukaani_1.1.97 to tukaani_1.2.0rc1

  * Fixed a bug from pkgtool that broke the Remove command.
  * Man pages were proof read by Ville Koskinen.
  * Built separate packages for Tukaani, Slackware and Slamd64.

---

2005-12-24 - from tukaani_1.1.96 to tukaani_1.1.97

  * Fixed a bugin upgradepkg which could make some files to dissappear.
    In practice this issue should have affected only users of Tukaani
    Edge (not Slackware nor even Tukaani Solid) because we had started
    moving files from usr/{info,man,doc} to usr/share/{info,man,doc}.
    The actual bug was the old known symlinked directory handling bug in
    removepkg which probably will never be fixed. The fix in upgradepkg
    is a workaround for the removepkg issue.
  * Added a few abbreviations for pkgtool's command line mode. See the
    pkgtool(8) man page for more information.
  * Added ChangeLog creation support to makerepo.
  * Initial updates for man pages. :-)

---

2005-12-06 - from tukaani_1.1.95 to tukaani_1.1.96

  * Fixed stupid bug that showed message about upgraded pkgtools
    when pkgtools *haven't* been upgraded. Sorry.
  * Fixed another stupid bug that prevented pkgtools from being
    upgraded if it was the last package on the upgrade list.
    This was related to the feature which installs glibc-solibs
    at very first and pkgtools at very last package.

---

2005-12-05 - From tukaani_1.1.93 to tukaani_1.1.95

  * Fixed a bug that prevented listing the *.new files at the end of
    the package installation.
  * Added missing --verbose switches to installpkg and upgradepkg.
  * Preliminary support for upcoming LZMA utils 4.30.
  * Applied a patch to tar-1.13 which adds --no-overwrite-dir. The
    /bin/tar-1.13 executable is now renamed to /bin/tar-1.13-pkgtools
    to prevent problems if the user reinstalls Slackware's tar package.
  * pkgtool: Upgrade glibc-solibs as the very first step if it has been
    chosen to be upgraded. Upgrade the pkgtools package as the last step
    to prevent any possible incompatibilities between the old pkgtool
    and new installpkg/upgradepkg.
  * Added more service names and descriptions to config-services.
  * Upgraded dialog to 1.0-20051107.
  * Added Linuxpackages.net to the mirror list.
  * Modified config-xwm to a more flexible form and added support
    for /opt/*/etc/X11/xinit/.

2005-11-14 - From tukaani_1.1.91 to tukaani_1.1.93

  * Fixed a few bugs, thanks to Teemu Suo-Anttila (Fal)

---

2005-11-14 - From tukaani_1.1.0_beta1 to tukaani_1.1.91:

  * Changed version numbering scheme. Now odd minor number means
    a development version, even is stable. (This is exactly how Linux
    kernel releases are numbered.)
  * Sync with Slackware 10.2 pkgtools.
  * The code has been splitted to smaller files. This makes code easier
    to read and maintain. pkgtool still needs a lot of cleanups, all the
    other scripts should be fine already.
  * convertpkg and explode now handle .rpm and .deb packages. There is no
    need to have any rpm specific tools installed, only cpio is needed.
    Debian packages need ar from binutils.
  * tukrepo is now known as makerepo. It now caches also MD5 and SHA1
    checksums. Updating PACKAGES.TXT is also notably faster.
  * setup.services has been rewritten to a saner form and made available
    as a command `config-services'.
  * xwmconfig has been renamed to config-xwm. To avoid making old user
    angry, a symlink xwmconfig->config-xwm has been created.
  * Nicer boxes in command line mode of installpkg and upgradepkg. ;-)
  * Many significant speed improvements.
  * A few important fixes to Tukaani Installer related code. Thanks to
    T. Tamminen (ThemeS) for help!
  * Lots of non-critical bugfixes (mostly cosmetical).

---

2005-08-07 - From tukaani_1.0.0 to tukaani_1.1.0_beta1:

installpkg:
  * Verify GPG signatures. The default can be set in /etc/pkgtools/config
    or manually with command line options --gpg and --no-gpg. The default
    configuration is set to verify the signatures of all packages
    downloaded from the net and not check for local packs.
  * Use 'install-info' to add new GNU info documents to info's directory
    file (/usr/info/dir or /usr/info/dir.gz). When needed, the whole
    directory file can be reconstructed from scratch.
  * Added a new command line option --base which allows you to specify
    the base directory or URL which is prepended to every package name
    specified on the command line.
  * Major speed improvement for executing doinst.sh. The trick is to
    modify the commands that create the symlinks to a saner form. With
    packages having lots of symlinks this will make execution of
    doinst.sh three to four times faster, which can be many seconds
    even on two-gigaherz computer.
  * Run ldconfig only when new shared libraries are installed. This
    check is not perfect; ldconfig might get run sometimes when it's not
    needed, but it will be always run when it is really needed.

upgradepkg:
  * New command line option: --base

removepkg:
  * Use 'install-info' to delete the directory entries of info pages
    being removed.

pkgtool:
  * No longer use FILELIST.TXT because all the required information is
    avaialable in PACKAGES.TXT.
  * Try to download PACKAGES.TXT.gz before PACKAGES.TXT. The file is
    about 30% of original size when gzipped.
  * Added Update&Open to repository filter menu; now it is easy to
    update the repository without going through Actions menu or
    using QuickUpdate.
  * In command line mode: default to the first repository if reponame
    is omitted.
  * Verify MD5 sums of packages if CHECKSUMS.md5 contains them.
  * Automatically hides all pkgtools packages that do not contain
    'tukaani' in the filename. This might sound evil but it is just
    to prevent accidental downgrades and the problems it could cause.
  * Tukaani Installer related bugfixes.

makepkg:
  * Speed improvements in symlink deletion and permission/ownership
    modifications code using the 'xargs' command.

tukrepo (formerly slackrepo):
  * Dispite the name tukrepo can be used to create Slackware compatible
    PACKAGES.TXT, CHECKSUMS.md5 and FILELIST.TXT files.
  * The function to create PACKAGES.TXT is completely rewritten and
    it works well now. :-)
  * In addition to uncompressed files, create also gzipped versions.
    (PACKAGES.TXT.gz, CHECKSUMS.md5.gz etc.)
  * Support slapt-get's extensions in PACKAGES.TXT (required, conflicts
    and suggests).
  * Optionally you can include MD5 and/or SHA1 sums to PACKAGES.TXT.
    Use this feature with care since not necessarily all the 3rd party
    tools accept PACKAGES.TXT files having these fields.

shared_functions.sh:
  * unset POSIXLY_CORRECT since it breaks at least the sed scripts of
    pkgtool which use GNU extensions.

disksets.txt
  * Updated

---

2005-05-18 - From tukaani_1.0.0_rc3 to tukaani_1.0.0:

  * Very important bug fix in "upgradepkg --install-new"
  * Changed LZMA options in makepkg to faster values. The effect
    on compression ratio should be negligible.
  * Corrected the LZMA memory requirements in the man page of makepkg.
    This is *not* related to the above change in makepkg itself.
  * Some minor code cleanups
  * Released the first stable release. :-)

---

2005-05-02 - From tukaani_1.0.0_rc2 to tukaani_1.0.0_rc3:

  * Fixed a minor bug in convertpkg.
  * Added 'menu-dir <directory>' to command line mode of pkgtool.

---

2005-04-30 - From tukaani_1.0.0_rc1 to tukaani_1.0.0_rc2:

  * Fixed broken Setup menu in pkgtool - (sorry, I try to never break
    working code again ;) )  This bug was found by Antti Aalto.
  * Fixed malfunction of pkgtool command line commands 'menu',
    'menu-desc', 'search' and 'search-desc'. The bug occurred only when
    the results contained packages from 'extra', 'pasture' or 'testing'.
  * Fixed Actions->Update to not exclude 'pasture' and 'testing' with
    filters CustomName and CustomDesc. Removed a few lines of duplicate
    code at the same time.

---

2005-04-23 - Summary of changes from pkgtools-10.1.0-i486-4 to
             pkgtools-tukaani_1.0.0_rc1-i486-1:

Miscellaneous changes:
  * Moved scripts from {/bin,/sbin} to /usr/{bin,sbin}. To retain
    compatibility with 'checkinstall', a few symlinks were made to /sbin.
  * Moved 'explodepkg' and 'makepkg' from sbin to bin because they are
    useful to ordinary users too.
  * Jim Hawkins' bugfixed code for Remove and View commands in 'pkgtool'
  * General speed improvements in many places. E.g. package file is now
    decompressed only three times during upgradepkg. Original did it four or
    six times depending on if a .txt file containing the description was
    available.
  * New --warn mode in 'installpkg'. Instead of just showing the package
    contents it now checks what would be overwritten in reality.
  * 'makepkg' clearly shows what the default answer is, so the user can just
    press enter (or even give invalid input): [Y/n].
  * Behavior of --chown is changed in 'makepkg'. Now it chowns everything to
    root:root, and chmods all files and dirs with executable bit set to 0755
    and others to 0644.
  * Moved common functions to /usr/share/pkgtools/shared_functions.sh.
  * Updated the man pages.
  * Package information (like size) is now aligned right in /var/log/packages
    for better readability . Only spaces were added so this definitely
    shouldn't affect compatibility.
  * All long command line options (e.g. --reinstall) have a short
    counterpart (e.g. -r).
  * Most tools (but not all) use 'getopt' to parse command line options.
    Options no longer need to be given before package names.
  * Some command line options are no longer supported. Refer to the man pages
    for the officially supported options. Some backwards compatibility is
    retained by allowing long options to start with a single '-'. Don't
    count on it, though.
  * 'installpkg', 'removepkg', 'upgradepkg' and 'pkgtool' can be used
    only as root. (Bad change?)
  * Added rc.firewall and rc.ntpd to 'setup.services'. rc.dnsmasq is
    still excluded, should it be included too?
  * Upgraded to dialog version 1.0-20050306 with a trivial patch to make
    --help-button usable when combined with --item-info.
  * pkgtools no longer check availability of /bin/tar-1.13. tar-1.13 is
    now included with pkgtools to make sure it is available.

New features:
  * Added support for LZMA compressed (.tlz), bzip2 compressed (.tbz) and
    uncompressed (.tar) packages.
  * Added network support, requires 'wget'. You can now give 'installpkg'
    and 'upgradepkg' a HTTP or FTP URL on the command line.
  * 'pkgtool' is mostly rewritten. Supports multiple package repositories,
    Details-button in Remove menu, simple package database integrity check,
    totally new command line interface.
  * A few options can be set using the configuration file /etc/pkgtools/config.
  * 'makepkg' can be now used by ordinary users as long as it is OK that all
    the files in the package will be owned by root:root.
  * When installpkg or upgradepkg finishes, a list of the new *.new
    files left on the disk is shown. I hope most users now remember to
    check the *.new files and update their configuration after upgrading.
  * 'installpkg', 'upgradepkg' and 'makepkg' show a warning if the package
    name does not conform to the Slackware naming standard. They do not
    prevent installation nor ask any confirmation.
  * 'makepkg' warns if the created package does not have a description.
  * New command: 'convertpkg' converts between different package
    compression formats.
  * New command: 'viewpkg' shows detailed package information. It also
    makes comparing of two packages easier. 'viewpkg' has many command line
    options which make it easy to get the exact output format you need.
  * New command: 'slackrepo' creates a Tukaani compatible repository that
    contains FILELIST.TXT and PACKAGES.TXT.

Bugfixes:
  * Fixed handling of special characters like spaces in filenames given
    in command line. E.g. this kind of command works now:
    installpkg "My Packages/foo-0.12-i486-1barney.tgz"
  * bash and ash wrongly assume that root can read everything so
    [ -r /path/foo ] returns always true. This is not true e.g. with NFS.
    'installpkg' and 'upgradepkg' now check the package integrity before
    trying to install so unreadable package files are no longer a source of
    trouble. Original pkgtools use [ -r ] correctly, but because of the
    shell's buggy behavior the package gets removed instead of upgraded. :-/
  * --warn mode of 'installpkg': If package didn't have 'install/doinst.sh',
    empty temporary directory was left in $TMP.
  * Made 'installpkg' better handle packages that are not created with
    'makepkg'. E.g. package created with "tar czf foo-0.1-i486-1bar.tgz *"
    is now stored correctly in the package database.
  * The method of making the symbolic link creating script is rewritten.
    Please refer to makepkg(1), section COMPATIBILITY for details.

Bugs that are not fixed:
  * If two packages have files that overlap, but the directory in the packages
    differ because of a symlink (or symlinks), removepkg deletes the
    overlapping file(s). Luckily this bug is fairly rare. See removepkg(8)
    for detailed explanation.
