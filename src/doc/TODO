Since Larhzu is no longer planning to add any new features to pkgtools,
don't except him to implement any of these. Maybe someone else is
willing to continue the work on pkgtools.

Important:
  * Add GPG signing to `makerepo'.
  * Add a filter for searching filenames inside the packages. It has
    been quite common question on IRC "what package contains `foo'".
    This feature would require downloading and parsing MANIFEST.bz2.
  * Regular expression support to blacklist file.
  * Show how many megabytes has been downloaded and total download size.
  * Improve command line of pkgtool.

Not important:
  * SHA1 sum support
  * Detect terminal size and adjust sizes of the dialogs. It would be
    nice to see more packages at once when using a big terminal.
  * `dialog' based editor for the list of the blacklisted packages

Experimental ideas:
  * Download and install simultanously; could be much faster when installing
    many packages. Especially useful in setup program mode.
  * Use binary diffs to distribute updates. Users with slow connection
    would be happy to download 200 kB instead of 15 MB.

Things that will *NOT* be added:
  * Dependency support. If you like dependency things you need to use some
    other software (slapt-get is recommended).
  * scp and sftp support
